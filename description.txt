The Shape class provides calculate_area and calculate_perimeter methods that raise NotImplementedError. 
This serves as a signal to derived classes that these methods must be overridden.
`get_color` and `set_color` methods manage the color attribute.

`Rectangle`: Implements calculate_area and calculate_perimeter using the length and width of the rectangle.

`Triangle`: Implements calculate_area using Heron's formula and calculate_perimeter using the side lengths of the triangle.

`Circle`: Implements calculate_area and calculate_perimeter using the radius of the circle.

Main Program:
Demonstrates creating instances of Rectangle, Triangle and Circle.
Stores these instances in a list, iterates over them, and prints their area, perimeter, and color.
